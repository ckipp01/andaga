# ándaga - a personal time tracker

After a full year of logging everything locally, I decided to split ándaga into two parts: the [ándaga-core](https://github.com/ckipp01/andaga-core) which serves as the api for my ándaga time tracking system, and the ándaga-cli, which is this project

You can see the system prior to being split up [here](https://github.com/ckipp01/andaga-cli/tree/year-one) and you can read more about my time tracking system [here](https://wiki.chronica.xyz/#andaga) on my [wiki](https://wiki.chronica.xyz).

Currently, ándaga-cli has 3 commands:

  `andaga log`  used for logging new entries
  `andaga recall` used for recalling old log entries
  `andaga category` used for displaying a list of used categories
